### Styling

- Customize file formats

## üìß Email Notifications (Optional)

To add email notifications when forms are submitted, you can modify `contact_handler.py`:

```python
import smtplib
from email.mime.text import MIMEText

def send_email_notification(submission):
    # Configure your email settings
    smtp_server = "your-smtp-server.com"
    smtp_port = 587
    email_user = "your-email@domain.com"
    email_password = "your-password"

    # Create email content
    subject = f"New Contact Form: {submission['subject']}"
    body = f"""
    New contact form submission:

    Name: {submission['name']}
    Email: {submission['email']}
    Subject: {submission['subject']}
    Message: {submission['message']}
    """

    # Send email
    msg = MIMEText(body)
    msg['Subject'] = subject
    msg['From'] = email_user
    msg['To'] = "admin@yourlibrary.com"

    with smtplib.SMTP(smtp_server, smtp_port) as server:
        server.starttls()
        server.login(email_user, email_password)
        server.send_message(msg)
```

## üì± Mobile Responsiveness

The contact form and admin interface are fully responsive:

- Touch-friendly form inputs
- Responsive table layouts
- Mobile-optimized navigation
- Adaptive text sizes

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Form not submitting**:

   - Check if contact handler server is running on port 8081
   - Look for JavaScript errors in browser console
   - Verify form fields are properly filled

2. **Admin panel not loading submissions**:

   - Ensure contact handler is running
   - Check browser console for network errors
   - Verify server URL in admin panel

3. **Data not saving**:

   - Check file permissions in contact_data directory
   - Verify Python script has write access
   - Look at server console for error messages

4. **Local storage fallback**:

   - When server is unavailable, forms save to browser's local storage
   - View saved data using "Local Storage" button in admin panel
   - Data persists until manually cleared

### Debug Mode:

Enable debug output by running the contact handler with:

```bash
python3 contact_handler.py --debug
```

## üìà Analytics and Reporting

The system provides basic analytics through the admin interface:

- Submission trends (daily, weekly, monthly)
- Popular subject categories
- Response time tracking

For advanced analytics, you can:

- Import CSV data into Excel/Google Sheets
- Use the JSON data with analytics tools
- Build custom reports using the stored data

## üîÑ Backup and Recovery

### Automatic Backups:

- System creates backups every 100 submissions
- Backups stored in `contact_data/contact_backups/`
- Each backup includes timestamp in filename

### Manual Backup:

```bash
# Copy data files
cp -r contact_data/ backup_$(date +%Y%m%d)/

# Export via admin interface
# Visit http://localhost:8080/admin-submissions.html
# Click "Export CSV" button
```

### Recovery:

```bash
# Restore from backup
cp backup_YYYYMMDD/* contact_data/

# Or restore individual files
cp backup_YYYYMMDD/contact_submissions.json contact_data/
```

## üìû Support

## üéØ Production Deployment

For production use, consider:

1. Using a proper web server (Apache/Nginx)
2. Adding SSL/HTTPS certificates
3. Implementing database storage instead of files
4. Adding email notifications
5. Setting up monitoring and logging
6. Implementing user authentication for admin panel
7. Adding CAPTCHA for spam protection
